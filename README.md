The purpose of this project is to identify the alleles from the 8 major loci when given a FASTQ file. The 8 major loci that are in in the database are D21S1437, D12S1090, D3S1744, D14S608, D4S2366, D18S536, D13S765, and AMEL

The txt file contains all of the possible alleles and their respective reverse complementaries in sorted order.
